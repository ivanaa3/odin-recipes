    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When Courtney Page Ferrell set out to find her grandmother's 
        long-lost apple pie recipe, she got much more than she bargained for. 
        The Virginia-based creative consultant and sought-after speaker put 
        up 'Lost Pie' signs around her neighborhood (and other cities, when 
        she was traveling) and received a slew of recipes and stories from 
        other apple pie lovers. This delicious double-crust old-fashioned 
        apple pie is the closest she came to her grandmother's beloved recipe.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>For the crust:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All-purpose flour: The base of the crust. Be sure to scoop flour 
        into the measuring up with a spoon and level when measuring for 
        consistent results.</li>
    <li>Unsalted butter or cold vegetable shortening: Use whichever you 
        prefer or a combination of both (see below).</li>
    <li>Kosher salt: Enhances the flavor of the crust. 
        Leave out if using salted butter.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the filling:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Tart apples: We like Granny Smith or McIntosh, but feel free to 
        use whichever type(s) of apples you prefer.</li>
    <li>Granulated sugar: You can also use light or dark brown sugar for 
        subtle notes of caramel.</li>
    <li>All-purpose flour: Helps thicken the filling. Can be swapped with 
        cornstarch or other preferred thickeners.</li>
    <li>Ground cinnamon: Spices up the filling for a warming touch.</li>
    <li>Kosher salt: Enhances the flavor of the apples.</li>
    <li>Unsalted butter: Adds richness to the filling.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Mix together flour, butter, and salt in a large bowl with your
         fingertips until butter is well incorporated. Gradually sprinkle 2 to 
         4 tablespoons very cold water into mixture, kneading as you add water,
          until dough just comes together. Knead dough to a smooth ball on a 
          lightly floured surface. Divide and shape into two disks. Wrap and 
          chill 2 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>Let 1 disk stand at room temperature about 5 minutes. Roll into 
        a 12-inch circle and fit into a 9-inch pie plate. Chill.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 425°F with oven rack in lowest position. Stir 
        together apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt. Spoon into piecrust; 
        sprinkle with butter.</li>
    <li>Roll remaining disk to a 12-inch circle. Cut into 12 strips and 
        arrange in lattice pattern over apples. Trim and crimp edges.</li>
    <li> Place pie onto a rimmed baking sheet. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce temperature 
        to 350°F and bake 45 minutes. Cover loosely with aluminum foil if needed, 
        and bake another 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack at least 1 hour 
        before serving.</li>
</ol>
